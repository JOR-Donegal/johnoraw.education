# Introduction

I have been writing course content since the last millenium (sad but true!). Changing platforms has been the bane of my life. Moving my documents to an open format and to a technology that I can sync and save seems to be a good idea.

After two years of experimentation with my own accounts, this is a new dedicated teaching account as of mid-2025.

Enjoy!
