I have been writing course content since the last millenium (sad but true!). Changing platforms has been the bane of my life. Moving my documents to an open format and to a technology that I can sync and save seems to be a good idea. After two years of experimentation with my own accounts, this is a new dedicated teaching account as of mid-2025. Retirement is hopefully not too far away! I want the notes in this repo to be available to my students after I retire, this is one way to do so.","title":"About"},{"location":"contact/","text":"Contact me via my University e-mail address","title":"Contact"}]}
